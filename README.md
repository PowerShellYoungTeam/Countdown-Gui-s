# Countdown-Gui-s
Just me playing about with some Gui's that countdown and fire an action, when I find the article I got code from will give credit

## Countdown-LSEClose

Just a wee timer so I know when the markets close today.. (I have traders as part of the users I support..)

Just change $Duedate on line 8 for different time (Like New Years Eve ;D)

$DueDate = Get-Date -Date "24/12/2021" -Hour 12 -Minute 30 #Due Date/Time!

## Countdown-Shutdown

another bit of fun, this will kill apps (Process names) you list in $Apps on line 88 before shutting down your machine, As now markets closed boss is happy if we monitor via work smartphones for next few hours
